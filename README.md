# clock

## Description

Clock application that allows users check their current time and location and see information about the date and time. User can also generate random programming quotes. Also the application changes its look based on time of the day. This is a solution to the [Clock app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clock-app-LMFaxFwrM).

## Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Webpack

## Future improvements

- Clock and styling should change dynamically with different periods of the day (currently it changes after reloading the page).
- Improve the loading time.

## Bugs

- Data does not load when AdBlock or Ublock are enabled in the user's browser.

## Summary

The goal of this project was to reinforce my JavaScript and Sass skills. I also wanted to learn using Webpack and working with multiple web API's.
